A React app is in this folder, its source in ./src. Its dev server is already running at the url in ./dev-url.txt and
reloads as the source changes.
The complaint: typing a message into the message box lags.
To reproduce: open the page, click the message box at the bottom and type a short message, "see you at five".
I recorded it with the recorder's panel in the page; the recording's id is in ./recording.txt.
Find out whether anything on the page re-renders for nothing, and why. Fix what does in ./src without changing what
the page shows, and show with before-and-after numbers that the fix worked. If nothing does, say so and change
nothing.
